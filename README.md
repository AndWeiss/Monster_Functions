# An interactive learning tool / video game. 

For students of 7th grade in German Gymnasium.  

The goal is to hit the monsters that appear in random positions with a ball. 
To hit the monsters a parameter of the function must be calculated (proportionalitätsfaktor, gesamtgröße).

The start position varies depending on the target relation. 

In the moment implementet are 

- direct proportional relations (linear functions throw the origin, f=ax)
- indirect proportional relations (hyperbolic functions, f=a/x)


## how to use

first click on the screen to make shure the window is active

1. use your keybord to enter the parameter 
2. use ENTER to release the ball (shoot)
3. use SPACE to refresh and calculate new monsters at new positions
4. repead at 2

## Variations

- With the key "t" you can change from direct proportional to indirect proportional relations
- with the key "r" the vertical origin is randomly shifted


## To Do

The code can be extended to fit different kind of functions, such as

- polynomials of any degree (practical would be up to third or fourth degree)
- harmonic functions (sin, cos)
